Project Overview

What it does
------------
Automated validation framework that finds "Workload Tipping Points": where commodity hardware (x86, ARM64) hits the Memory Wall and enterprise hardware (IBM Power10) keeps scaling. Measures performance deltas and resilience (MTTR under fault injection).

Lab
---
Same stress tests on three tiers: Edge (Pi 5 / ARM64), Commodity (x86 laptop), Enterprise (Power10 / ppc64le).

Pillars
-------
1. Capability — CPU/memory throughput scaling (stress-ng, thread sweeps).
2. Resilience — SIFI fault injection; measure Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR).
3. Efficiency — I/O saturation and memory-wall behavior (fio, block-size sweeps).

Deliverables
------------
Validation harness (Python + Docker), tipping-point visualizations, resilience comparison (e.g. Power10 vs x86 recovery times), and an assurance methodology write-up.
