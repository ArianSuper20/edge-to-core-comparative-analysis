Multi-ISA Comparative Analysis: Validating I/O Saturation and Memory Wall Deltas across the Edge-to-Core Continuum

1. Executive Summary
The objective of this project is to develop an automated validation framework that characterizes the performance and resilience deltas between s390x, x86, and ARM64 environments. Rather than focusing on raw compute speed, this testbench identifies "workload tipping points", specific thresholds where the LinuxONE’s specialized I/O subsystems and on-chip accelerators (CPACF/NNPA) justify their architectural overhead compared to commodity hardware.
The project utilizes a Tri-Architecture Validation strategy:
Multi-Platform Delta Analysis: Quantifying the efficiency gap between enterprise (s390x) and commodity (x86/ARM64) systems.
Resilience Quantification: Utilizing Software-Implemented Fault Injection (SIFI) to measure how enterprise hardware recovers from systemic stress compared to standard consumer-grade systems.

2. Technical Pillars & Scope
The framework is built upon three engineering pillars designed to map directly to IBM Systems Engineering requirements:
Pillar	Activity	Engineering Goal
Pillar 1: Architectural Profiling	Benchmarking CISC vs. RISC instruction sets via sysbench and Python wrappers.	Track A: Identify "tipping points" where s390x scales linearly while x86/ARM64 hit architectural bottlenecks.
Pillar 2: I/O & Accelerator Offload	High-concurrency storage stress (fio) and cryptographic acceleration tests.	Track B: Quantify the "Turbo Button" effect—measuring throughput deltas when offloading to CPACF or NNPA.
Pillar 3: Resilience & SIFI	Injecting "bad path" scenarios (signal-based interrupts, memory pressure, and network latency).	Fault Injection: Use SIFI to quantify the recovery time and stability of enterprise hardware vs. commodity control groups.

3. The Tri-Architecture Validation Strategy
Track A: Workload Tipping Points (s390x vs. x86 vs. ARM64)
This track establishes the "Mainframe Advantage." By running identical workloads across the LinuxONE partition, an x86 laptop, and a Raspberry Pi 5, we identify the exact saturation point where commodity hardware fails to maintain deterministic performance.
Primary Metric: Throughput () and Latency () variance under exponential concurrency scaling.
Control Group: Pi 5 (ARM64) represents the power-efficient baseline; x86 represents the standard compute baseline.
Track B: SIFI & Resilience Quantification
Using Software-Implemented Fault Injection, we simulate systemic failures (e.g., dropped packets via tc, process interrupts, or memory leaks) to observe the "graceful degradation" of the s390x.
Primary Metric: Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) and system availability under stress.
Comparison: Measuring how the LinuxONE’s enterprise-grade firmware and hardware-level error handling outpace commodity OS recovery.

4. Semester Roadmap (Spring 2026)

5. Key Deliverables
Automated Validation Harness: A modular GitHub repository with Python scripts capable of multi-platform execution and data aggregation.
Tipping Point Analysis Report: A formal document featuring data visualizations (heatmaps/scatter plots) showing where s390x outperforms x86 and ARM64.
SIFI Resilience Log: A detailed log documenting "bad path" recovery results, comparing enterprise vs. commodity hardware stability.

6. Systems Engineering Justification: Why s390x?
I/O Hub Superiority: While x86 and ARM64 are compute-heavy, the s390x is architected as a massive I/O hub, essential for high-velocity transactional data.
Resilience by Design: Commodity systems rely on software for recovery; s390x integrates recovery into the silicon (RAIM, lock-step processing).
Mission Criticality: This framework validates the hardware powering the global economy, from banking to large-scale systems engineering.
